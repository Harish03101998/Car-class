Using Pandas accessed the data in csv from.
Analyzed the data to find any missing values and outliers.
Since the data don't have any missing values, proceeded to next step.
The data had huge outliers.
To minimize outliers, standard scaler is used.
After that process, different machine learning techniques are applied to find which one suits best.
At final step I've taken Standard Vector Machine as apt model for this data.
Where the accuracy is 0.8 and f1 score is also 0.8.
